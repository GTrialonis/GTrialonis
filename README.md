- 👋 Hi, I’m George Trialonis, a retired translator / interpreter.
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Android Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all three of them, which is a daunting task.
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborating with other people with same interests.
